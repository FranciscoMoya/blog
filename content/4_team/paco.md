Telecommunications Engineer with a PhD from UPM in 2003 and Associate Professor in the Computer Architecture and Technology area at UCLM since 2019. He has been teaching at UCLM since 1998, holding positions such as Assistant Lecturer at the Technical School, Assistant at the Faculty, Associate Professor, and Tenured Professor at the School of Computer Science (Ciudad Real Campus), as well as Contracted Lecturer and Associate Professor at the School of Industrial and Aerospace Engineering in Toledo.

His research activity spans four main areas: 1) methodologies for the design of complex heterogeneous systems, 2) the application of distributed system concepts to the design of embedded electronic systems, sensor networks, and large-scale distributed services; 3) security in electronic systems; and 4) the application of computer vision and artificial intelligence techniques to a wide range of topics (e.g., ambient intelligence, defect analysis, and bioaerosol classification). He has participated in over 40 research projects, serving as Principal Investigator (PI) in 10 of them. He is the author of 21 articles in specialized journals and 67 conference papers. He also holds two patents and has supervised three doctoral theses.

During his doctoral thesis, he developed the concept of a pico-object, enabling a distributed infrastructure akin to the object-oriented architectures of the 1990s, offering partial fault transparency and complete location transparency. Unlike conventional distributed object architectures, pico-objects can be implemented in hardware on System-on-Chip platforms, wide-area multi-protocol networks, or IoT environments. This work continues in projects such as HADA, CORE, ARES, SODA, RGRID, DAMA, DREAMS, and SAND, focusing on middleware with advanced features for heterogeneous systems, including reconfigurable hardware components and services like persistence, implicit activation, replication, migration, and more.
